A C++ class for handling large integer numbers (greater than 64 bits) with arbitrary bases. Please note that the class isn't complete, doesn't compile and has never been tested.

## Overview

The `LongNumber` class is designed to represent large numbers with arbitrary bases (between 2 and 16, included), providing a set of operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports signed and unsigned integers and can be initialized from various data types, from standard integers to string.

## Dependecies

It does not rely on anthing but standard library 

## General features (below: feature yet implemented)

- Handles large numbers with arbitrary bases.
- Implements base conversion tools
- Arithmetic operations: comparisons, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo and power, everything both signed and unsigned
- Supports operations between LongNumbers with different bases
- Supports operations between LongNumbers and primitive types
- Constructor overloads for different numeric types and string representations.
- Custom exceptions for error handling.
- Designed with ease of use and flexibility in mind.
